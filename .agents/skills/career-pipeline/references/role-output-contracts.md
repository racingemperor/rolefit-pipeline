# Role Output Contracts

All role outputs should be structured enough for the orchestrator to merge.

Role prompts in this repository are frameworks for runtime local subagents. They define what to collect, which evidence is required, how to share context, and when to hand off. They should not make final career, company, market, learning, branding, HR, or resume-positioning judgments from repository priors alone.

## Common Fields

Every role should include:

```json
{
  "role": "",
  "task_summary": "",
  "inputs_used": [],
  "database_files_used": [],
  "source_notes": [],
  "runtime_scope": "evidence_collection|procedural_gate|conditional_runtime_judgment|drafting_from_user_facts|fact_checking",
  "judgment_allowed": "none|procedural_only|conditional_with_runtime_evidence|evidence_bound_only",
  "judgment_status": "framework_only|runtime_evidence_required|ready_for_runtime_judgment|evidence_bound_judgment|blocked",
  "decision_owner": "local_subagent|user|factual_reviewer|hr_supervisor|orchestrator|none",
  "runtime_preconditions": {
    "has_current_jd": false,
    "has_target_company": false,
    "has_user_constraints": false,
    "has_user_consent": false,
    "job_direction_blocked": false
  },
  "evidence_basis": [],
  "artifact_refs": [],
  "execution_log_refs": [],
  "invocation_ref": "",
  "role_output_packet_ref": "",
  "error_recovery_state_ref": "",
  "repository_prior_usage": [],
  "weight_provenance": [],
  "blocked_outputs": [],
  "degraded_outputs": [],
  "conditional_options": [],
  "runtime_research_tasks": [],
  "evidence_requirements": [],
  "shared_context_refs": [],
  "handoff_to": [],
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "needs_user_confirmation": []
}
```

Use `evidence_bound_judgment` only when the judgment is limited to supplied user materials, current JD text, current public evidence gathered by runtime subagents, or a static taxonomy/schema lookup. Use `runtime_evidence_required` or `blocked` when current evidence or user-owned facts are missing.

Use `artifact_refs`, `execution_log_refs`, `invocation_ref`, `role_output_packet_ref`, and `error_recovery_state_ref` for traceability. A role output that cannot be tied to a run, invocation, artifact, or role output packet should not be merged into a final package.

Each `evidence_basis` item should identify the supported claim:

```json
{
  "claim_id": "",
  "field": "",
  "source_type": "user_provided|official_or_primary|recruitment_platform_jd|verified_hr_public_post|candidate_experience_secondary|social_media_weak|repository_prior|inference",
  "source_ref": "",
  "user_owned_or_public": "user_owned|public|repository",
  "evidence_strength": "strong|medium|weak|missing",
  "inference_level": "none|low|medium|high",
  "confidence": "high|medium|low"
}
```

`repository_prior_usage` and `weight_provenance` must state whether a static database was used only as a prior. Repository priors must never be the sole basis for `fit_score`, `priority`, `asset_priority`, `skill_priority_weights`, `external_asset_weights`, `school_signal_weights`, or HR/company judgments.

For concrete job or internship requests, roles should separate:

- `current_fit_assessment`: evidence-bound current suitability for the exact target role.
- `skill_gap_analysis`: must-have, nice-to-have, evidence, and narrative gaps against the current JD.
- `learning_plan_before_application`: skills, projects, proof artifacts, and completion conditions needed before applying.
- `application_readiness_decision`: apply now, prepare first, or skip only when current JD/public evidence and user evidence are sufficient.

If current JD evidence is missing, these fields must be blocked or marked `not_available` rather than inferred from repository priors.

Every proposed parameter weight, score, priority, ranking, threshold, or confidence adjustment must be supported by hard data. A role must not set weights by intuition, popularity assumptions, or model-only reasoning. If runtime public/official network evidence or user-provided materials are missing, set the weight status to `not_available` or `needs_more_sources`, add `runtime_research_tasks`, and block downstream decisions that depend on that weight.

Each `weight_provenance` item should use:

```json
{
  "parameter": "",
  "proposed_weight": null,
  "weight_status": "verified|needs_more_sources|not_available",
  "source_refs": [],
  "source_types": [
    "current_jd|official_company_page|official_campus_page|recruitment_platform_jd|verified_hr_public_post|official_school_notice|public_report|multi_source_candidate_signal|user_provided|repository_prior"
  ],
  "retrieved_or_published_dates": [],
  "sample_size_or_source_count": "",
  "evidence_strength": "strong|medium|weak|missing",
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "cannot_decide_alone": true
}
```

Use `cannot_decide_alone = true` for repository priors, single weak social posts, stale sources, or model inference.

## Runtime Execution And Artifact Fields

Runtime wrappers should preserve these fields when available:

```json
{
  "execution_manifest": {
    "run_id": "",
    "current_stage": "intake_received|input_normalized|context_packet_created|injection_ready|agents_running|merge_pending|debate_required|hr_review_required|factual_review_required|user_confirmation_required|blocked|final_package_ready",
    "runtime_context_packet_ref": "",
    "secondary_prompt_injection_refs": [],
    "subagent_invocation_refs": [],
    "artifact_manifest_ref": "",
    "artifact_refs": [],
    "evidence_packet_refs": [],
    "runtime_weights_ref": "",
    "error_recovery_state_ref": "",
    "final_package_ref": ""
  },
  "subagent_invocation": {
    "invocation_id": "",
    "run_id": "",
    "target_agent": "",
    "base_prompt_ref": ".codex/agents/<agent>.toml",
    "secondary_prompt_injection_ref": "",
    "runtime_context_packet_ref": "",
    "input_packet_ref": "",
    "allowed_user_facts_ref": "",
    "database_files_to_read": [],
    "source_policy_refs": [],
    "research_tasks": [],
    "hard_data_weight_tasks": [],
    "required_output_fields": [],
    "output_artifact_target": "",
    "expected_artifact_types": [],
    "required_log_events": [],
    "privacy_constraints": [],
    "handoff_contract": [],
    "debate_contract": [],
    "timeout_or_budget_hint": "",
    "retry_allowed": true,
    "on_failure": "return_blocked|rerun_with_more_context|handoff_to_orchestrator",
    "status": "not_started|running|done|blocked|failed|malformed"
  },
  "role_output_packet": {
    "invocation_id": "",
    "target_agent": "",
    "status": "done|done_with_warnings|needs_context|blocked|failed|malformed",
    "role_output_ref": "",
    "evidence_packet_refs": [],
    "runtime_weights_ref": "",
    "artifact_refs": [],
    "blocked_outputs": [],
    "runtime_research_tasks": [],
    "needs_user_confirmation": [],
    "errors": []
  },
  "artifact_refs": [],
  "execution_log_refs": []
}
```

The canonical schemas live in `runtime-execution-layer.md`, `subagent-invocation-contract.md`, and `runtime-artifact-schema.md`. Role prompts may return references instead of embedding entire artifacts.

Artifact references should include `artifact_id`, `run_id`, `artifact_type`, `path`, `created_by`, `privacy_class`, and safety flags when material is persisted locally. Runtime logs should be redacted by default.

Specialist role prompts should return `role_output_packet` and `error_recovery_state` inline when no runtime wrapper is present. When a wrapper is present, the wrapper may persist those objects and the role output may return `role_output_packet_ref` and `error_recovery_state_ref`; the orchestrator must resolve the refs before merging.

## Error Recovery Fields

When a role blocks, fails, returns malformed output, or produces only safe partial output, expose:

```json
{
  "error_recovery_state": {
    "status": "not_applicable|recovered|degraded|needs_user_confirmation|needs_public_research|blocked|failed",
    "errors": [],
    "recovery_actions": [],
    "degraded_outputs": [],
    "blocked_outputs": [],
    "safe_outputs": [],
    "next_action": "continue|ask_user_once|run_public_research|retry_agent|run_debate|run_hr_review|run_factual_review|return_blocked_package"
  }
}
```

If output is degraded, downstream roles may merge safe factual fields, `evidence_basis`, `blocked_outputs`, and `runtime_research_tasks`, but must not merge final fit scores, application priorities, HR pass status, or resume tailoring decisions that depend on the failed evidence.

## Collaboration And Debate Fields

Roles that prepare or challenge fit, learning, branding, resume structure, HR readability, or factual-risk decisions should also include:

```json
{
  "agent_claims": [],
  "evidence_challenges": [],
  "disagreements_with": [
    {
      "agent": "",
      "field": "",
      "reason": "",
      "requested_resolution": ""
    }
  ],
  "handoff_questions": []
}
```

Use these fields when one role challenges another role's claim or when a conclusion depends on missing runtime evidence. Do not silently erase disagreements. If a conflict depends on missing user evidence, return a user-confirmation point instead of forcing a final recommendation. If a conflict depends on public or official evidence, create `runtime_research_tasks` and hand off to the responsible local subagent.

## Input Normalization Fields

The first stage should expose:

```json
{
  "input_type": "chat_brief|resume_text|markdown_file|pdf_docx|personal_website|github_or_portfolio|jd_text|jd_link|mixed|unknown",
  "first_round_user_profile": {
    "definition": "User-provided first-round self-profile, status, experience, goals, concerns, links, files, and resume materials; not system configuration.",
    "identity_and_contact": {},
    "education_status": {},
    "major_and_discipline": {},
    "internship_experience": [],
    "project_competition_research_experience": [],
    "skills_and_tools": [],
    "external_assets": [],
    "target_direction": {},
    "preferences_constraints": [],
    "current_concerns": [],
    "materials_provided": []
  },
  "runtime_context_packet": {
    "packet_id": "",
    "created_from": "first_round_user_profile",
    "first_round_user_profile_ref": "",
    "known_user_facts": [],
    "missing_user_owned_facts": [],
    "public_research_needed": [],
    "runtime_weight_questions": [],
    "privacy_constraints": [],
    "blocked_outputs": [],
    "next_possible_actions": []
  },
  "known_information_summary": "",
  "next_possible_actions": [],
  "candidate_stage": "non_graduating|graduating|graduate|unknown",
  "school_context": {},
  "application_scenarios": {
    "internship": {},
    "future_full_time": {},
    "current_full_time": {}
  },
  "missing_user_owned_facts": [],
  "one_round_followup_prompt": "",
  "job_direction_blocked": false
}
```

Use these fields to support vague chat introductions, complete files, websites, Markdown, links, and mixed materials without forcing the user into repeated Q&A. `next_possible_actions` should tell the user what can be done with current information before asking for missing facts.

`first_round_user_profile` is the normalized form of what the user initially says or provides about themselves, such as school, major, grade, personal status, internship, projects, competitions, skills, target direction, constraints, and current concerns. Keep private contact details redacted in intermediate outputs unless the resume role explicitly needs them and the user authorized final resume contact fields.

## Runtime Subagent Injection Fields

Before user-side specialist subagents run, the orchestrator should expose:

```json
{
  "runtime_context_packet_ref": "",
  "secondary_prompt_injections": [
    {
      "target_agent": "",
      "base_prompt_ref": ".codex/agents/<agent>.toml",
      "runtime_context_packet_ref": "",
      "role_specific_context": {},
      "allowed_user_facts": [],
      "research_tasks": [],
      "hard_data_weight_tasks": [],
      "database_files_to_read": [],
      "source_policy_refs": [],
      "invocation_contract": {
        "invocation_id": "",
        "run_id": "",
        "target_agent": "",
        "base_prompt_ref": ".codex/agents/<agent>.toml",
        "secondary_prompt_injection_ref": "",
        "runtime_context_packet_ref": "",
        "input_packet_ref": "",
        "allowed_user_facts_ref": "",
        "database_files_to_read": [],
        "source_policy_refs": [],
        "research_tasks": [],
        "hard_data_weight_tasks": [],
        "required_output_fields": [],
        "output_artifact_target": "",
        "privacy_constraints": [],
        "handoff_contract": [],
        "debate_contract": [],
        "expected_artifact_types": [],
        "required_log_events": [],
        "timeout_or_budget_hint": "",
        "retry_allowed": true,
        "on_failure": "return_blocked|rerun_with_more_context|handoff_to_orchestrator"
      },
      "blocked_outputs": [],
      "required_output_fields": [],
      "handoff_contract": [],
      "debate_contract": []
    }
  ],
  "secondary_injection_status": "ready|blocked",
  "secondary_injection_blockers": []
}
```

Each injected prompt must be derived from `runtime_context_packet`, the target role's static prompt, and the smallest relevant database subset. Do not dispatch a specialist with only the static role prompt. Do not pass all user data to every role; minimize private and irrelevant facts by role.

## Runtime Orchestration Fields

Pipeline-level orchestration should expose:

```json
{
  "run_state": {
    "run_id": "",
    "stage": "intake_received|input_normalized|context_packet_created|injection_ready|agents_running|merge_pending|debate_required|hr_review_required|factual_review_required|user_confirmation_required|blocked|final_package_ready",
    "task_type": "resume_review|resume_generation|job_search|jd_analysis|company_research|tailored_resume|major_positioning|personal_branding|learning_plan|target_job_fit",
    "runtime_context_packet_ref": "",
    "secondary_prompt_injection_refs": [],
    "subagent_invocation_refs": [],
    "active_agents": [],
    "completed_agents": [],
    "blocked_agents": [],
    "failed_invocations": [],
    "artifact_manifest_ref": "",
    "shared_context_refs": [],
    "evidence_packet_refs": [],
    "execution_log_refs": [],
    "debate_topics": [],
    "user_confirmation_points": [],
    "blocked_outputs": [],
    "degraded_outputs": [],
    "recovery_actions": [],
    "next_action": "normalize_input|create_injections|dispatch_agents|merge_outputs|run_debate|run_hr_review|run_factual_review|ask_user_once|return_blocked|return_final_package"
  }
}
```

Use `run_state` to prevent silent stage skipping. If a required gate is missing, return `blocked` or keep the current stage with explicit blockers.

## User Interaction Fields

User-facing intake and follow-up steps should expose:

```json
{
  "user_interaction_state": {
    "interaction_mode": "resume_only|direction_analysis|targeted_application|learning_plan|personal_branding|unknown",
    "information_completeness": "sufficient|partial|insufficient",
    "user_followup_policy": "one_round_only",
    "known_information_summary": "",
    "next_possible_actions": [],
    "missing_user_owned_facts": [],
    "subagent_research_not_asked_from_user": [],
    "incomplete_resume_consent_required": false,
    "incomplete_resume_allowed": false,
    "application_direction_allowed": false,
    "blocked_outputs": [],
    "one_round_followup_prompt": ""
  }
}
```

Use this state to keep first responses concise: summarize known facts, explain what can and cannot be done, then ask one compact batch for missing user-owned facts only when needed.

## Parameter Ownership Fields

Roles that ask questions, research public data, or set weights should expose:

```json
{
  "parameter_ownership": {
    "user_required_minimal": [],
    "user_optional": [],
    "subagent_research": [],
    "runtime_weight_config": []
  },
  "runtime_weight_config": {
    "skill_weights": [],
    "external_asset_weights": [],
    "school_signal_weights": []
  },
  "runtime_weights": [
    {
      "parameter": "",
      "weight_scope": "skill_weight|external_asset_weight|school_signal_weight|application_strategy_weight|hr_screening_weight",
      "proposed_weight": null,
      "weight_unit": "0_to_1|percentage|rank|tier|qualitative",
      "weight_status": "verified|needs_more_sources|not_available",
      "evidence_basis": [],
      "source_count": 0,
      "source_mix": [],
      "freshness": "0_6_months|6_12_months|1_3_years|older|unknown",
      "conflict_notes": [],
      "confidence": "high|medium|low",
      "cannot_decide_alone": true,
      "runtime_research_tasks": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Do not hard-code concrete skill or external-display requirements from repository examples alone. Let local subagents research current role, company, school, and discipline evidence from public/official network sources or user-provided materials, then configure weights at runtime only when `weight_provenance` is sufficient.

## HR Supervision Status

HR-supervised steps should expose:

```json
{
  "company_hr_signal_refs": [],
  "target_company_screening_bias": [],
  "big_tech_hr_screening_notes": [],
  "competitive_signal_summary": [],
  "hr_first_screen_risks": [],
  "hr_readability_score": null,
  "positioning_verdict": "pass|revise|required_user_confirmation",
  "pass_to_next_stage": false
}
```

`HRSupervisor` checks whether the pipeline output is understandable, credible, and competitive from a first-screen HR perspective. `positioning_verdict` is a runtime process status for presentation readiness, not a final hiring or career-fit verdict. It cannot override `FactualReviewer` on truthfulness.

When company-specific or big-company screening evidence is missing, `HRSupervisor` should mark `judgment_status = "runtime_evidence_required"` and use company-signal databases only as priors or source-collection guides.

## Evidence Notes

Use `source_notes` to distinguish:

- `official_or_primary`
- `recruitment_platform_jd`
- `verified_hr_public_post`
- `candidate_experience_secondary`
- `social_media_weak`
- `user_provided`
- `inference`

## Resume Approval Status

Resume-producing steps must use:

```json
{
  "format_gate_status": "pass|revise_required|user_confirmation_required",
  "format_status": "accepted|rejected|needs_user_confirmation",
  "factual_review_status": "not_reviewed|pass|revise|required_user_confirmation",
  "incomplete_resume_allowed_with_user_consent": false,
  "incomplete_resume": false,
  "job_direction_blocked": false
}
```

`ResumeFormatGate` sets the procedural drafting gate. It checks whether supplied materials satisfy the format and evidence-readiness schema. `ResumeArchitect` cannot mark final approval. Only `FactualReviewer` can mark the final resume as `pass`.

If the user refuses to provide missing information, incomplete resume drafting requires explicit consent. Missing sections must be omitted rather than filled with placeholders, and application direction recommendations must remain blocked.
