# Career Pipeline

This skill is the main entrypoint for the Codex-native career and resume agent design.

Use it to route user requests across specialized subagents, read the bundled static databases, and return a source-aware decision package. Do not deploy anything from this repository automatically; this repository is the design and prompt source of truth.

## Required References

Read these references as needed:

- `references/data-catalog.md` before using any static database.
- `references/source-policy.md` before analyzing job, company, HR, candidate, or social media information.
- `references/runtime-collaboration-protocol.md` before dispatching or merging role prompts.
- `references/runtime-execution-layer.md` before running, simulating, or implementing the local user-side execution shell.
- `references/runtime-subagent-injection-protocol.md` before creating user-side subagent prompts.
- `references/subagent-invocation-contract.md` before converting a secondary prompt injection into a concrete local subagent invocation.
- `references/runtime-orchestration-protocol.md` before running or simulating the user-side pipeline state machine.
- `references/runtime-artifact-schema.md` before writing, reading, merging, or exposing runtime artifacts, logs, evidence packets, resume drafts, or final packages.
- `references/error-recovery-protocol.md` before retrying, degrading, blocking, or partially merging a failed run.
- `references/user-interaction-flow.md` before asking the user for missing facts or handling incomplete information.
- `references/runtime-weight-engine.md` before proposing, checking, or merging any runtime weight, score, priority, ranking, threshold, or confidence adjustment.
- `references/role-output-contracts.md` before merging subagent outputs.

## Built-In Databases

Use repository-relative paths:

- `data/discipline_taxonomy/` for discipline-domain routing across engineering, science, humanities, social science, business, arts/design, medicine/health, agriculture, law/public affairs, and interdisciplinary backgrounds.
- `data/major_taxonomy/` for the currently implemented engineering major taxonomy, employment clusters, cross-tags, and major lookup.
- `data/runtime_parameters/` for deciding which parameters are user-owned, optional, researched by local subagents, or weighted at runtime.
- `data/school_signals/` for source policy and schema for school-company cooperation, campus recruiting, internship, and full-time opportunity signals.
- `data/company_signals/` for company-level hiring signals, source evidence, and company x major-cluster priors.
- `data/resume_formats/` for reusable resume section logic, format variants, and format accept/reject rules.

Never paste an entire database into the prompt. Load the smallest file and subset needed for the active role.

## Pipeline

Default full route:

```text
InputNormalizer
  -> Career Orchestrator
  -> MajorClusterClassifier
  -> ProfileExtractor
  -> JDAnalyzer
  -> JobScout
  -> CompanyIntelligenceAnalyst
  -> MarketSentimentAnalyzer
  -> MatchStrategist
  -> LearningPathStrategist
  -> PersonalBrandingStrategist
  -> HRSupervisor
  -> ResumeFormatGate
  -> ResumeArchitect
  -> FactualReviewer
  -> HRSupervisor
```

Short routes:

- Major positioning: `InputNormalizer -> MajorClusterClassifier`.
- Resume review: `InputNormalizer -> ProfileExtractor -> ResumeFormatGate -> ResumeArchitect -> FactualReviewer -> HRSupervisor`.
- Job analysis: `InputNormalizer -> JDAnalyzer -> CompanyIntelligenceAnalyst -> MarketSentimentAnalyzer`.
- Job search: `InputNormalizer -> MajorClusterClassifier -> ProfileExtractor -> JobScout -> JDAnalyzer -> MatchStrategist -> LearningPathStrategist`.

## Operating Rules

- Prefer user-provided materials and official/public sources over memory.
- Treat every `.codex/agents/*.toml` file as a role framework for runtime local subagents, not as a frozen decision engine.
- Normalize vague chats, Markdown, resumes, websites, links, and mixed materials through `InputNormalizer` before specialist agents.
- Convert the user's first-round self-described profile, status, experience, goals, and materials into a `runtime_context_packet`, then have `CareerOrchestrator` create role-specific `secondary_prompt_injections` before any user-side specialist subagent runs.
- Convert each `secondary_prompt_injection` into a traceable `subagent_invocation`; record `execution_manifest`, `artifact_refs`, `execution_log_refs`, `role_output_packet`, and `error_recovery_state` for runtime work.
- Track user-side execution with `run_state`; do not skip normalization, context packet creation, secondary injection creation, merge, debate, HR review, factual review, or user-confirmation gates when they are required.
- Do not silently merge blocked, failed, malformed, or partially recovered outputs into the final package. Merge safe partial fields only when the error recovery protocol allows it and the limitation is visible in `blocked_outputs`, `degraded_outputs`, or `runtime_research_tasks`.
- Ask the user for missing user-owned facts once in a compact batch. Do not ask the user for data that local subagents can research from allowed public sources.
- Treat concrete skill weights and external-display asset weights as runtime decisions. The repository provides schemas and examples, not universal requirements that every discipline must follow.
- Require hard-data provenance for all weights, scores, priorities, rankings, thresholds, and confidence adjustments. Local subagents must verify them through public/official network sources or user-provided materials; if evidence is missing, return `not_available`, `needs_more_sources`, and runtime research tasks instead of guessing.
- For non-graduating candidates, split current internship analysis from future full-time preparation.
- School-company cooperation and school-specific hiring advantages require official or primary runtime evidence; never infer them from school name alone.
- Treat company-signal data as priors, not current role-specific requirements.
- For a concrete job, require fresh JD text or current public JD retrieval before final resume tailoring.
- Use candidate/social media information only as auxiliary preparation or risk signals unless it is verified by official sources.
- If runtime evidence is missing, return research tasks, evidence requirements, blocked outputs, conditional options, and handoff targets instead of a final judgment.
- Do not store or expose private resumes, private chats, IDs, addresses, or non-public HR/candidate information. Intermediate reports and logs should redact phone numbers and personal emails by default; final resume drafts may include user-authorized contact fields when the user explicitly provides them for the resume.
- Resume writing may improve structure, evidence, and wording, but must not create false experience, fake metrics, fake ownership, fake education, or fake awards.
- Complete resume drafts must pass `ResumeFormatGate` before drafting and `FactualReviewer` before being presented as final.
- If the user refuses to provide missing information, generate an incomplete resume draft only after explicit consent and after `ResumeFormatGate` marks the incomplete-draft exception. Omit missing sections, block application direction recommendations, and warn that targeted advice requires detailed information.
- The whole pipeline should remain under `HRSupervisor` review: personal branding, resume strategy, and final packages must be quickly understandable to HR and show credible competitive signals.
- Agents should debate conflicts through structured fields. If claims conflict, preserve the disagreement, request evidence, or hand back to the relevant agent instead of silently merging incompatible conclusions.

## Role Prompt Files

Role prompt frameworks live in `.codex/agents/*.toml`.

Each file contains:

- role identity and scope.
- database dependencies.
- professional prompt instructions.
- expected output contract.
- hard prohibitions.

When a role needs static data, read the dependency paths listed in its TOML first.
